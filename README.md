## music-timesaver

Morden life is short, we are busy with stuff.  
music-timesaver is a python script to change the music piece's duration to half of its original.  
No speed up nor time stretch.  
music-timesaver will let you listen to one music piece's even seconds in left ear and odd seconds in right ear at the SAME time.  
This will allow you to spend half of the time for enjoying music.

### Demo included
*ayrtbh_KloneConcerts3.mp3* is a piece from my 2008 Max/MSP algorithm piano music album [***The Klone Concerts***](http://www.tokafi.com/news/net-feature-wang-changcun-klone-concerts/).  
*ayrtbh_KloneConcerts3.mp3_in_half_time.mp3* is the music-timesaverEd piece.
